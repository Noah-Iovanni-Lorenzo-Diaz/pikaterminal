# PikaTerminal
Just a silly little thing that i made so my terminal plays a pikachu animation everytime it opens.
Just:
- Rename bashconfig as .bashrc and put it in your ~/ directory or copy its contents in your already existing .bashrc.
- Copy the contents from txt folder and put them in the directory ~/.anim/ (create it), you can also change the path in the .bashrc file.

And done!
